--challenges faced in SQL Server
1. Plan cache issue - SSIS package is failing because of the plan cache issue. In the input Excel file we get different types of data(numerical and alphabetical) from business people that must be validated and only numerical values should be inserted into the database. We have to execute the same SSIS package multiple times in a day. First time if we get the correct data  package is running fine. If we execute the package with different set of data next time, previous generated paln is not suitable with current data. To successfully load the data we need to always enforce to generate a new plan for every SSIS package. To do this we are creating a stage based physical table every time. So, new object is being used in every time, so new plan is being generated every time.
