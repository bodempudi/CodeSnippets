We can use case statements in SQL Server to derive a new column as part of your result set. This derivation will be based on existing columns from tables. In the query, we write this case statement as an expression everywhere (select/join condition, update set statement, group by, order by).

Case statement in SQL Server comes in two flavors. One is in a Simple case statement and another one is in the form Search case statement. In 

```sql
