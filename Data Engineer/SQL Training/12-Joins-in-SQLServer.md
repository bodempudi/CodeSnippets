# Joins in SQL Server

As we know ```SQL Server``` has been created based on two mathematical concepts, they are ```Set Theory``` and ```Predicate Logic```. In set theory, the cartesian product is the basic operation. Joins in ``SQL Server``` also works in the same way as the Cartesian product.
```
In mathematics, the Cartesian Product of sets A and B is defined as the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x belongs to A and y belongs to B. For example, if A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then the Cartesian Product of A and B is {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}.
```
