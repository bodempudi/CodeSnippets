Usually When we apply joins between tables in SQL Server, it requires a minimum of two tables a left table and a right table to apply join between them. Both left and right tables need not be tables, they can be table expressions, table expressions can be either subquery, CTE, or Views.

Sometimes it requires an output of one should be passed as an input to the other(Outer) query.
